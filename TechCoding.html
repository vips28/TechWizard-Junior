CYBER CUP JUNIOR TECHNICAL CODING ROUND

Q1. All submissions for this problem are available.Vasya learned about integer subtraction in school. He
is still not very good at it, so he is only able to subtract any single digit number from any other number
(which is not necessarily single digit).
For practice, Vasya chose a positive integer nn and wrote it on the first line in his notepad. After that, on
the second line he wrote the result of subtraction of the first digit of n from itself. For example, if
n=968n=968, then the second line would contain 968−9=959, while with n=5 the second number would
be 5−5=0. If the second number was still positive, then Vasya would write the result of the same
operation on the following line, and so on. For example, if n=91 then the sequence of numbers Vasya
would write starts as follows: 91,82,74,67,61,55,50,… One can see that any such sequence eventually
terminates with the number 0.
Since then, Vasya lost his notepad. However, he remembered the total number k of integers he wrote
down (including the first number n and the final number 0). What was the largest possible value of n
Vasya could have started with?

Input:
The first line contains T , number of test cases per file.
The only line in each test case contains a single integer k− the total number of integers in Vasya&#39;s
notepad (2≤k≤10 12 ).

Output:
Print a single integer−− the largest possible value of the starting number nn. It is
guaranteed that at least one such number n exists, and the largest possible value is finite.

Constraints
● 1≤T≤34
● 2≤k≤10 12

Q2. You are a citizen of Arrayland. Your President (Mr. P) has given you a mundane
problem:
You&#39;re given an array a with size N (1-based indexing). You are allowed to perform an
arbitrary number (including zero) of operations of the following type: choose an integer i (1
≤ i ≤ N) and swap a i with a N-i+1 .

Your goal is to make the array a great. An array is great if it satisfies one of the following
conditions:

● a 1 &gt; a 2 &lt; a 3 &gt; a 4 &lt; ... a N
● a 1 &lt; a 2 &gt; a 3 &lt; a 4 &gt; ... a N

Compute the minimum number of operations necessary to make the array a great or
determine that it&#39;s impossible to make it great.

Input
● The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test
cases. The description of T test cases follows.
● The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of
the array a.
● The second line contains N space-separated integers a 1 , a 2 , ..., a N .

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations required to
make the array great, or -1 if it&#39;s impossible.

Constraints
● 1 ≤ T ≤ 5
● 1 ≤ N ≤ 10 5
● 1 ≤ a i ≤ 10 9 for each valid i

Q3. SudokuX is a variation of the popular game Sudoku. Similar to standard Sudoku, in
SudokuX, we have to enter the numbers 1 - 9 once in each row, column and 3 x 3 square
within the 9x9 puzzle grid. In addition to standard Sudoku, the numbers must only occur
once in each of the two diagonals.

Johnny is very interested in playing SudokuX. He believes that this game is so challenging
that even the best computer programs could not solve it efficiently.

Let&#39;s show Johnny the power of computers by writing a program to solve even the hardest
SudokuX puzzles within seconds!

Input
The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of 9 lines. Each line contains 9 characters &#39;.&#39; (blank grid), or &#39;1&#39;..&#39;9&#39;
representing a SudokuX puzzle.

Each test case is separated by a blank line.
You are guaranteed that each given SudokuX puzzle has a unique solution.

Output
For each puzzle, output the solution in the same format as the input. Print a blank line after
each test case.
